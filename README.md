## María Verónica Sonzini (October 1984 to date)

I'm a bioimages productor, passionate about life sciences and, recently, software development. I have been working in the software industry for a couple of years, as a software tester at Hewlett Packard (Argentina) and after that I've been doing iOS self learning for 18 months. My family and I decided to make a huge change of life and we moved from Argentina to London on January 2016, and that's when I decided to start for real a new page in my life's book, joining Makers Academy. 
I'm looking for a Full Stack Junior Developer role where I can grow and continue to learn. In order to pursue my dreams, I would love to bring together both my knowledge in medical and biological sciences and in sofware development. I want to change the world, and for that I'm looking for an organization that loves to create great software and contribute to the development and better understanding of science.
